# Mrs Gutierrez Amazon Page

Hi! This little project lets you explore jobs on a pretend Amazon account page.

## How To Get It Running
1. **Install GitHub Desktop (works on Mac + Windows)**
   - Go to https://desktop.github.com and click the purple download button.
   - Open the downloaded file, keep clicking "Next"/"Continue" until it finishes.
2. **Grab this project with GitHub Desktop**
   - Open GitHub Desktop, click "File" ➜ "Clone repository."
   - Paste `https://github.com/WarrenFerrell/Mrs_Gutierrez_jobs_unit_amazon_account_page.git`.
   - Pick a folder you like (Desktop is fine) and click "Clone."
3. **Open the page**
   - In GitHub Desktop, press "Show in Finder" (Mac) or "Show in Explorer" (Windows).
   - Double-click `Your Account.html`. Your browser shows the page right away.
   - Close the tab when you are done exploring.

 Want to use a tiny web server instead? Install Node.js, open Terminal/PowerShell, run `node run start`, and it will open the browser for you.
